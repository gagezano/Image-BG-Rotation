# Image BG Rotation

This is a lightweight copy of the hero feature space with an animated background sequence that cycles through grayscale tiers. The example keeps the same timing mechanics as the Arc hero slideshow but uses placeholder labels ("Image 1", etc.) and a Helvetica-based, black-and-white palette so the functional behavior can be referenced without reusable Arc content.

- Slides rotate automatically every 3 seconds.
- Every slide fits into a responsive layout and keeps the hero copy left-aligned.
- The footer indicator shows the current slide label.
